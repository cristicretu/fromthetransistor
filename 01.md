## Cheating our way past the transistor

What is a transistor?

= Electrical component that acts as a switch or an amplifier for electrical signals.
Imagine it as a gate that can either allow or block the flow of water in a pipe.

By arranging transistor in specific configuratons, we can build logic gates. These gates perform logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR. Combining them we can create complex circuits such as adders, multiplexers, registers, and memory units.

Adders are typically connected in a specific arrangement to perform binary addition.
Multiplexers are used for data routing and selection purposes.
Registers are composed of flip-flops (0 and 1), and are used for temporary storage of data.

Integrated circuits (ICs) are miniaturized electronic circuits, essentially collections of transistors packaged together.

A FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a type of IC, that can be programmed to implement various digital logic circuits. 

FPGA = CLB (configurable logic blocks)

CLBs contain look-up tables or LUTs, flip-flops. A LUT is an array that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation. You can think of this similar to a times tables to avoid calculations (like 9x1, 9x2, ... 9x9)
To program an FPGA, designers use hardware description languages HDLs like VHDL or Verilog.
